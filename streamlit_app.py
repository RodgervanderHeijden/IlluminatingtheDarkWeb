        In the context of the course Data Forensics of their master's degree Data Science & Entrepreneurship, two 
        students - Thaibinh Luu and Rodger van der Heijden - were tasked to develop insights into criminal behaviour on 
        the web. Drawn by the interesting nature of the assignment, they shared an extreme motivation to not only finish
        this assignment, but to make something truly special of it. 

        This project is heavily focused on counterfeit/falsified medicine, drugs and NPS.
        We saw the most potential in this ANITA scenario and believe it has the most information available on the internet. 
        Furthermore, as these illicit goods may negatively impact public health, it is of great essence to monitor and analyse the flow of these products.
        As a lot of illegal trafficking is facilitated by marketplaces on the dark web, we were motivated to analyse the supply and demand on this specific level of the internet. 
        
        The ultimate goal of this project is to gain valuable insights in one of the largest dark web marketplaces for drugs: ToRReZ.
        By thoroughly analysing this market, we hope to get a sense of the popular types of drugs, the drug flow, supply, demand and so on. 
        Better understanding the market may help in identifying key players and keeping track of illegal drug flows so law 
        enforcement agencies can proactively take action. 

        Data was collected by crawling and scraping the dark web marketplace ToRReZ. To do so, and to be able to extract
        exactly the desired data, we wrote our own crawler and scraper. Data collection occurred on the 5th of 
        March. Be aware that any offers, vendors and pricing therefore may already be outdated.

        Insights derived from the retrieved data were diligently analysed, with the key takeaways shared in the 
        dashboard in front of you. The side panel on the left contains a table of contents, which allows for navigation.
        The first pages contain a more introductory approach to the data with insights of descriptive nature. The last
        one specifically goes into some hypotheses we defined in advance and were able to answer over the past weeks. 
        During this research several (related) insights where also found, which we highlight there as well. 
        
        Where possible (and where logical) we have included the option for interactivity, which presents itself in the 
        ability to hover of data, zoom, pan and select subsets. We strongly encourage the reader to use the sandbox to 
        their own liking; we merely provide the tools that allow you to discover additional insights. 

        In case any question remains, some confusion arises or additional information is desired, please do contact us. 
        Wishing you the best reading experience possible, 

        Thaibinh Luu and Rodger van der Heijden

             By accessing the market, we were exposed to a lot of interesting data. We found that the marketplace 
             offers all kinds of illicit goods. Besides drugs and chemicals, also software & malware, fraud and many more 
             products are offered. Our category of interest, however, is 'Drugs and Chemicals'. 
             This section contains all drug and chemical related products offered on the market. 
             At the time of scraping, this section had 14.013 product offerings. Besides all these products, 
             the vendor pages also contain a lot of valuable information.
             
             To capture all this relevant information required for analysis, we built our own crawler and scraper 
             from scratch. Scraping is done using the BeautifulSoup package in Python. This package allowed us to 
             pick the relevant information from the HTML we were interested in. For the product pages we scraped the 
             vendor name, category levels, product name, price and shipping locations. The same approach is used for 
             the vendor pages. However, this time we scraped the vendor name, rank, verification, number of 
             transactions, feedback, and disputes. The crawler that we made allowed us to go through pages to scrape 
             all the information. For the product pages, the crawler goes through all of the 721 pages. For the 
             vendors, it goes through all vendor pages that have at least one offer in the category 
             ‘Drugs and Chemicals’. More specific information can be found in the code, where comments are also 
             provided for better understanding the workflow.

        ### 1. _Cannabis & Hash_ is the most popular category on the marketplace. 

        Ten out of the top 50 vendors have over 50 offers just on these drugs, with 3 out of the top 4 vendors selling
        either exclusively or almost exclusively these drugs. 

        ### 2. There are two kinds of _Cannabis & Hash_ vendors.

        Vendors like California420service, PitStopUK or kandykones only offer weed (100% of offers), 
        while RoyalMailer (84%), StrainPirate (98%) and topmoneymaker (92%) clearly prioritize the category. Vendors 
        for whom _cannabis & hash_ aren't the main priority generally sell in a lot of other categories, but almost 
        all of them sell _Stimulants_ and _Psychedelics_.
        
        ### 3. _Prescription drugs_ vendors and _Steroids_ vendors specialize in these drugs.
        
        Similar to the main _cannabis & hash_ vendors, vendors of _prescription drugs_ and vendors of _steroids_ 
        barely sell anything else. Vendors as akgeneric, SteroidWarehouse, thebodyshop, bestgroup and PSteroids almost 
        exclusively sell drugs from within these two categories. Curiously, none of the vendors sell _cannabis & hash_, 
        despite that being the most popular drug.
        
        ### 4. Three distinct types of vendors can be identified.   

        Based on the available offers per vendor, we can identify three blocks of vendors. 
        #### &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; 1. _Cannabis & Hash_
        #### &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; 2. _Dissociatives, Ecstacy, Opiates, Stimulants, Psychedelics_
        #### &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; 3. _Benzos, Prescriptions Drugs, Steroids, Weight Loss, Accessories_""")

        ### 5. _Buds & Flowers_ explains popularity _Cannabis & Hash_
        
        With the noted presence of _Cannabis & Hash_, we see that _Buds & Flowers_ are mainly responsible for this 
        effect. Most subcategories however are barely sold, not in quantity in offers nor in quantity of vendors. A 
        possible explanation would be that there are a lot of strains for cannabis, and logically the type of flower
        matters to prospective buyers. For other types of drugs, say cocaine, only purity matters, and individual 
        vendors do not have dozens of types of cocaine. 
        
        ### 6. _Ketamine_, _MDMA_ and _Cocaine_ are popular
        
        On the other hand, _Ketamine_, _MDMA_ and _Cocaine_ are sold by a lot of different vendors (and often the same 
        vendors), but a single vendor has at most 28 offers of one category. We can hypothesize about the underlying 
        reasons, partly already explained in the previous finding, but it's peculiar nonetheless. 
    """)

    st.markdown("""
        ### 7. Several subcategories are only sold by one or a few vendors
        
        For instance, the subcategories as _Seeds_, _Synthetic_, _GBL_, _Powder_, _Codeine_, _4-FA_, _TMA_, _DMT_ and 
        _Mescaline_ are only offered by at most two vendors out of the top 50. In a similar vain, vendors that offer 
        drugs in the _Cannabis & Hash_ (blue), _Ecstacy_ (orange) or _Stimulants_ (green) categories generally offer 
        multiple subcategories if not all. On the flipside, vendors that sell drugs within the _Benzos_ (red) or 
        _Opiates_ (beige) categories only sell one specific subcategory. Due to our limited expertise we cannot 
        formulate a hypothesis that could potentially explain this.
        
        ### 8. _Prescription drugs_, _Steroids_ and _Weight Loss_ drugs do not have subcategories
 
        With a total of 1158 offers within these categories, one could propose that further specification is in place. 
        ToRReZ however does not allow any subcategories within these categories. Scrolling through the offers here show
        a wide variety of drugs in each one, though we're unaware whether a proper (categorical) distinction could 
        possibly be created. For your discovery, we have included a view of the offers within these categories.

        ### 9. Vendors with a lot of offers are cheaper on average 
        
        When looking at the vendors that offer a wide variety of drugs within a category, for instance RoyalMailer with
        310 offers within the Cannabis & Hash category, we see that their mean product price is quite low. Or look at 
        vendors LucySkyDiamonds (a reference to the Beatles hit song about LSD) and Hofmanncrew: despite being the most
        active vendors on ToRReZ, their average price is a lot less pronounced. 
        
        ### 10. Drug offer prices are more dependent on the vendor than the actual drugs
        
        When looking per category, we see that the larger dots do correlate with the category. Of course, we also saw
        this effect on the _Product Insights_ page. Stimulants and Dissociatives for example contain sizable markers.
        However, quite to our surprise, the differences in offer price between sellers within a category is larger than 
        the differences in offer price between categories. 
        
        ### 11. Vendors that specialize in certain categories are cheaper on average than vendors that sell everything.
        
        The specialists, such as RoyalMailer, kandykones, California420Service, StrainPirate or PSteroids, are notable 
        within their drug category and primarily sell (a lot of) one specific group of drugs. However, they do not 
        appear in the right graph, which shows the average listing price. This seems counter-intuitive to us, as one
        could pose that expertise could translate into more specified listings and also more expensive. A pedigree of 
        quality, if you will. However, since the inverse seems true, we suggest that it's maybe a question of scale: if
        you can sell large quantities of drugs, then the production and sale of drugs per unit decrease, and 
        undercutting your competitors can in turn ensure that your sales increase even more. This theory is given some 
        credence by the two vendors that sell exclusively from Australia (and as we have seen earlier, exclusively to 
        Australia): though _inc_ has more offers overall, _auspride_ is (significantly) more expensive.
        
        ### 12. The top vendors have several shipping locations
        
        Vendors like drkend, akgeneric, TheBodyShop and NarcoticsWorldwide post their offers with several locations 
        where they ship from. For drkend it's mainly China with a bit of Canada, for akgeneric it's primarily India
        with 28 offers from the United States, TheBodyShop also ships from India primarily but offers other drugs from
        the Netherlands, and NarcoticsWorldwide it's between Germany and Australia. With the opportunity to offer 
        multiple types of drugs getting shipped from multiple countries, we are confident that these vendors are part 
        of a large organisation.

                    To make a fair comparison we computed the mean number of offers per category per verification level. 
                    The mean number of offers is mapped to the size as well as the color.
                    Although higher levels are scarce, we observe a difference in their product offerings. 
                    The lower level vendors sell all kind of drugs while higher level vendors focus on specific categories. 
                    Furthermore, all low level vendors seem to focus on the popular categories (Cannabis & Hash) which is 
                    consistent with our findings in the previous chapter. Higher level vendors have different product offerings.
                    Especially the vendors in level 15 stand out with their extreme offer in Steroids.
                    Looking at this group in more detail we observe that level 15 contains 3 different vendors and that
